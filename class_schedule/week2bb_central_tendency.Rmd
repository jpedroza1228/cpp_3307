# Greek Terms

$$ \Sigma = Sum of scores  $$

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
21+ 21+ 25+ 23+ 24+ 23+ 20+ 19+ 24+ 25+ 21+ 21+ 26+ 22+ 22+ 24+ 20+ 19+ 19+ 20+ 20+ 23+ 21+ 21+ 37+ 23+ 19+ 26+ 34+ 33
```


$$ \Sigma\;X = Sum\;Of\;X   $$
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
x <- c(21, 21, 25, 23, 24, 23, 20, 19, 24, 25, 21, 21, 26, 22, 22, 24, 20, 19, 19, 20, 20, 23, 21, 21, 37, 23, 19, 26, 34, 33)

sum(x)

```

* Both of these are stating that we are adding all of the data points together.

* **Sum of X** is the sum of the scores in a sample
  - X is just another way to say all the data points for the variable.

---

# Central Tendency

* Concept that as statisticians every person is just a data point

* We are interested in the central score
  - We are interested in how much a person is away from that central score
  - But when it comes to statistics we like to group together our participants' scores/values
  
* **Measures of Central Tendency** are statistics that summarize the location of a distribution on a variable by indicating where the center is

* A Normal distribution will have the central point right down the center

* A skewed distribution will have the central point where the frequency of scores is the highest

---

# Normal Distribution Example

```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(082521)
normal <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
neg_skew <- rbeta(10000, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 2)
pos_skew <- rbeta(10000, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)

skew <- tibble::tibble(normal, 
                       pos_skew,
                       neg_skew) %>% 
  rowid_to_column()

```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
psych::describe(skew)[2:4, ][c("mean", "sd", "median")]
```

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
skew %>% 
  ggplot(aes(normal)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "gray70", color = "white", bins = 20, alpha = .5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 10000,
                args = list(mean = mean(skew$normal), sd = sd(skew$normal)),
                color = "black", size = 1.25) +

# The Mode

.pull-left[
![](https://i.imgflip.com/prj6o.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
* Value/score with the highest frequency

* Essentially useless in statistics

* **Unimodal distributions** distribution with only one hump; one value is the mode

* **Bimodal distributions** distribution with two humps; two values with the highest frequency; two modes

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
table(x)
```
]

---

# The Median

.pull-left[
![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/033/395/Thumbnail_expert_micro.png)
]

.pull-right[
* **Median** is the middle value/score; the 50th percentile

* Unlike the mode, it will always be close to the middle of a distribution

* You'll only ever have one median

* The symbol is:
$$Mdn = Median$$
]

---

# The Median

* Preferred for ordinal/ordered data

* Not the best option for normally distributed interval & ratio scores

* Is more reliable when dealing with skewed data

* *Important Note* If you have an even number of scores/values, then you will add the two middle values and divide by 2

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
odd <- c(1, 6, 3, 8, 9, 8, 3)
even <- c(1, 6, 3, 4, 9, 8, 5, 6)

sort(odd)
sort(even)

get_median <- (5+6)/2
get_median

median(odd)
median(even)
```

---

# The Mean/Average

* **Mean** is the score located at the `mathematical` center of a distribution

* Xbar is often used for the mean
  - $$ \overline{X} $$ 

* $$\overline{X} = \frac{\Sigma\;X}{N} $$ is the formula to calculate the mean.
  - Xbar is the Sum of X/Scores divided by the total number of observations/scores/values

* Calculate the mean for interval and ratio scales
  - The mean of ordinal/ordered data makes no sense
  
* Basis for most `inferential statistics`

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
x <- c(21, 21, 25, 23, 24, 23, 20, 19, 24, 25, 21, 21, 26, 22, 22, 24, 20, 19, 19, 20, 20, 23, 21, 21, 37, 23, 19, 26, 34, 33)

sigma_x <-  sum(x)
N <-  30

x_bar <- sigma_x/N

x_bar
mean(x)

```

---

# When to Use Each Measure

* The Median more accurately describes/summarizes skewed data compared to the mean
  - The mean will be pulled toward the extreme tail of the distribution
  
* Normal distribution then use the mean as the best measure to describe/summarize data

---

# The Mean in Research

* Most statistics revolve around the mean

* Can't just trust descriptive statistics like the mean

---

# Descriptive Statistics Are Never Enough

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(datasauRus)

ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol=4)
```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x),
            mean_y = mean(y),
            sd_x = sd(x),
            sd_y = sd(y)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_x, mean_y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 54.3, color = "red", linetype = 2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 47.8, color = "red", linetype = 2) + 
  xlim(50, 60) +
  ylim(40, 50) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset)
  
```

---

# Deviation

* The distance a participant's score/value is from the mean/average

* Deviations can be positive or negative
  - participants can score lower (negative) than the mean and higher (positive) than the mean
  
* To get the deviation, you subtract the mean from each participant's score

* $$ X - \overline{X} $$

* The larger the value the farther away from the mean the score/value is

* **Sum of the deviations around the mean** is the sum of all differences between the scores and the mean

---

# Example

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
x

one_part <- 37
another_part <- 19

x_bar

one_part - x_bar
another_part - x_bar

```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
all_deviations <- x - x_bar
all_deviations

sum_deviations <- sum(all_deviations)
sum_deviations
```

---

# Looking to the Future

* Deviations is the start for upcoming lectures and statistical tests, especially the sum of the deviations

* $$ \Sigma(X - \overline{X}) $$

* If the sum of the deviations is 0 then that means your math is good

* Deviation of each score/value from the mean is often referred to as error/residual in statistical tests

* Correlational designs use the mean of IV and the mean of DV to look for a relationship between the two variables

* Experiments compare the two or more groups (IV) and the relationship with the mean value/score of the DV

---

# Visuals

* Line Graphs are good for showing progress or change in time

* To show group differences (nominal or ordinal IV), bar graphs are the norm

* Scatterplots are best for continuous IV and continuous DV (interval or ratio)

# Describing the Population Mean

* $$ \mu = Population\;Mean $$

* If you test a population then you would use mu instead of xbar

* $$ \mu = \frac{\Sigma\;X}{N} $$

numbers2 = c(3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 4)
numbers3 = c(4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4)

(7 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 1)/5
```

```

# What are Measures of Variability?

* **Measures of Variability** are measures that examine how much scores differ from one another in a distribution
  - So if numbers are farther from one another, they will have more variability
  - It is also referred to as dispersion or spread; I refer to it as variation sometimes
  
* Low variability means that most values are close together, high variability means that values are spread out farther from one another

* Variability tells you how much your measure of central tendency is accurately measuring your distribution

---

# Several Measures of Variability

* **Range**

* **Variance**

* **Standard Deviation**

---

# The Range

$$ Range = highest\;score - lowest\;score $$

* **Range** tells you the distance between your highest score/value and your lowest score/value

* The book states that the use of the range is mostly for nominal or ordinal data.
  - JP disagrees. The range or more importantly, the highest and lowest scores are very important for knowing how extreme some observations are
  - Also important for seeing right away that there are outliers
  
---

# Sample Variance

* Variance tells you how different scores are from one another collectively

* This is measured by calculating how much all the scores vary/differ from the mean

* When we were looking at individual scores and how they differed from the mean, we looked at how much they deviated from the mean

* Now we are looking collectively at the sample

* We can think of variance as collective distance of the deviations from the mean

---
# Some more review

$$ X - \overline{X} $$

$$ \Sigma(X - \overline{X}) $$

* The Sum of deviations will always equal zero.

---

# What is Sample Variance

* Because the sum will always equal zero, one way to get away from that is to square the sum of deviations

$$ S^2_{x} = \frac{\Sigma(X - \overline{X})^2}{N} $$

* **Sample Variance** is the average of the squared deviations of the scores around the sample mean

* To get the variance, we will calculate the sum of the deviations squared by the total observations.

* This gives us the distance scores are on average from the mean

* One issue is that the variance is a large number, which can get confusing at times

* Also, interpretation is difficult due to being squared

---

# Sample Standard Deviation

* **Sample Standard Deviation** is the square root of the variance. It is a better measure of variability that better shows the average of the deviations from the mean

$$ S_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X - \overline{X})^2}{N}} $$

* Standard deviation and variance are very similar measures of variability
  - Both measure how much scores spread out from the mean

* Best interpretation is that the scores are "on average" this far from the mean

---

# Standard Deviation and Area Under the Curve

* We can use the normal distribution/bell-shaped curve/normal curve to then add/subtract standard deviations from the mean

* If the average test score is 92 and the standard deviation is 2.5, then stating you are one standard deviation above the average score means you got a 94.5

* Going back to proportions and frequencies, knowing standard deviations means you can understand how much of a normal distribution is accounted for

* When you are looking at +1SD you have 34% of the distribution accounted for, when +-1SD you then account for 68% of the distribution

---

# Population Standard Deviation &amp; Variance

* **Population standard deviation** is the square root of the average squared deviation of scores around the population mean

$$ \sigma_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^2}{N}} $$

* **Population variance** the average squared deviation of scores around the population mean

$$ \sigma^2_{x} = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^2}{N} $$

* These values are for the true population's measures of variability

---

# Population Standard Deviation &amp; Variance

* Examination of the population standard deviation and variance allows for us to interpret findings by using the normal distribution

---

# Estimating the Population Variance &amp; Standard Deviation

* The sample variance and sample standard deviations are only used to describe the variability of the sample

* They are **biased estimators**, which tend to underestimate the population variability by only using N

* We need a random sample to estimate a population, so we need a random sample of deviations

* We therefore need to get a sample of deviations, and N minus 1 reflects the variability of a population

* **Unbiased estimators** use sample data to estimate the population variability 

---

# Unbiased Estimators

$$ s^2_{x} = \frac{\Sigma(X - \overline{X})^2}{N - 1} $$

* **Estimated population variance** gives us the estimated amount of variation based on the sample we have

$$ s_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X - \overline{X})^2}{N - 1}} $$

* **Estimated Population Standard Deviation** is the standardized estimated amount of variation

---

# Interpretation of Estimated Measures of Variability

* Interpretation is how we would expect the distribution to be. 

* We might expect that 68% of the distribution is within the +-1SD of the mean

---

# Summary

* Descriptive variance and standard deviation is for the sample 

* When wanting to know how much scores vary from the population, we use the population variance and standard deviation

* When we are inferring about the population based on the sample we have, we compute the unbiased estimators, essentially meaning that we calculate N - 1 in our calculations

---

# Computing the Formulas for Variance &amp; Standard Deviation

* **Sum of Squared Xs** is calculating by squaring each score and then adding those values together

$$ \Sigma X^2 $$

* **Squared Sum of X** is calculated by adding all scores then squaring the sum

$$ (\Sigma X)^2 $$

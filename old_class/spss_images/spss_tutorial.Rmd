# Things We'll Learn With SPSS

* Changing scale of variables
* Recoding variables
  - reverse scoring variables
* dummy coding variables
* run descriptives
* run frequencies
* standardize variables (z-transform variables)
* Create bar graphs/histograms of variables 
* Creating composite scores

---

# Changing Scale of Variables

---

.pull-left[
* You'll need to go to the Variable View

* Click on `Measure` and change it to the appropriate measurement scale

* Scale is both ratio and interval scales combined
]

.pull-right[

]

#Recoding Variables

---

.pull-left[
* Go to Transform --> Recode into Different Variables
]

.pull-right[
![recode 1](recoding_1.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* Choose the variable you want to change by clicking the blue box to move the variable over

* Give it a new name and a label explaining the changes you are going to make

* Click Change

* Click on `Old and New Values`

]

.pull-right[
![recode 2](recoding_2.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* Choose the old value and provide a new value in the respective areas

* Make sure to click on `Add` below `New Value` so that you will actually make the changes

* Continue

* OK

* Your output window should open up afterward showing the changes you made
]

# Reverse Scoring Variables

---

.pull-left[
* One example of recoding is to reverse score

* You can check the values of variables in `Variable View` to see if they need reverse scoring
  - You'll most likely get this information from the published article

* Same steps as recoding from previous slides

* The screenshot shows that I am changing the order of the values

* Give it a meaningful name
]

# Dummy Coding Variables

---

.pull-left[
* Useful for analyses where we are comparing multiple groups or are controlling for additional variables
  - ANOVA does not use this, it does what are called post-hoc tests (we'll get there)
  - most useful in multiple regression

* To control/adjust for additional variables = Make sure we are accounting for important variables

* Go to `Create Dummy Variables`

* Only works for nominal and ordinal data (e.g., variables with categories)
]

.pull-right[
![dummy 1](dummy_1.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* move the variable over that you want dummy variables for

* put a name under `Root Names` so you know you created dummy variables
]

.pull-right[
![dummy 2](dummy_2.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* Additionally, you can use the recoding method and give them each a new name

* Old values would be all the options that you are not interested in
  - Using the class standing variable, I created a variable called freshman
    + Old values are 0 for all the old values that aren't freshmen (#1)

* So everyone is a 0 (e.g., 2 = 0, 3 = 0, 4 = 0, 5 = 0)
  - freshmen are 1 so we would keep it as 1 = 1
  
* Instead of doing it one-by-one, you can input the range of values
  - 2 through 5 for the old values

# Descriptive Statistics

---

.pull-left[
* Descriptive statistics are Analyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Descriptives
]

.pull-right[
![descriptive statistics](descriptives_1.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* Move the variables over that you want descriptive statistics of

* Click on `Options` to choose what type of descriptive statistics you want

* Continue

* OK

* It will then show you in the output
]

.pull-right[
![descriptive statistics 2](descriptives_2.jpg)
]

# Frequencies

---

.pull-left[
* Frequencies is also under Analyze --> Descriptive Statistics --> Frequencies
]

.pull-right[
![descriptive statistics](descriptives_1.jpg)
]

---


.pull-left[
* You will move your variables over

* Statistics gives you descriptive statistics 

* At the bottom there is `Display Frequency Tables`
  - Make sure this is checked to get frequency tables
  
* Charts will give you the option of either choosing bar graphs or histograms
  - This is the fastest way to get plots
]

]

# Z-transforming Variables

---

.pull-left[
* Go to descriptives

* Click on the `Save Stnadardized Values as Variables` at the bottom

* OK

* Now you'll have additional variables that are on a z-distribution
  - Run descriptives to see how they differ from the raw values
]

.pull-right[
![z-transformations](z_transformation.jpg)
]

---

# Plots

---

.pull-left[
* You can get basic descriptive plots through frequencies

* For more detailed graphs, Graphs --> Legacy Dialogs --> ...
  - Bar for bar graphs
  - Line for looking at time
  - Boxplot for analyses later on (t.test & ANOVA)
  - Scatterplot for analyses later on (correlation & regression)
  - Histogram for continuous variables to be shown on a histogram
]

# Creating Composite Scores

---

.pull-left[
* Go to Transform --> Compute Variable
]

.pull-right[
![compute](compute_1.jpg)
]

---

.pull-left[
* `Target Variable` is the name you want for your new variable

* In `Numeric Expression` you'll use this to create averages or summative scores for composite scores/variables

* The reasoning is rather than test all questions of a certain construct (e.g., depression), you test the average depression score based on all aspects of depression in each question combined

* Add all the variables up together that belong to a specific construct

* OK

* Output will automatically come up with your new calculation and new variable

# What is a One-Sample t-test

- It's pretty similar to a z-test
  - t-test used more often in behavioral research

- z-test requires we know population standard deviation
  - often not possible in behavioral research

- uses unbiased estimators (N - 1 formulas)

- computes something like the z-score for our sample mean
  - t-score
  
---

# One-Sample t-test

- parametric test for when the population standard deviation is unknown

- still compares the sample mean to the population mean

---

# Steps to One-Sample t-test

1. Statistical Hypotheses
  - what is the population mean and is your sample mean different from that population mean
    
    - H0: sample mean equals the population mean
    
    - H1: sample mean is different from the population mean
    
2. Select an alpha

3. Check assumptions
  
  - Outcome needs to be continuous (interval or ratio scale)
  
  - Population score forms a normal distribution
  
  - variability of raw score population is estimated from the sample
  
---

# Steps to One-Sample t-test

- All we need to know is the t critical value and if the t obtained value is within the regions of rejection

---

# Steps to a z-test/One-Sample t-test

- get population standard deviation (z-test)

- get estimated standard deviation (t-test)

--

- get the standard error (SE) of the mean (z-test)

- get the **estimated** SE (t-test)

--

- calculate the score by subtracting the population mean from the sample mean and dividing by the SE
  - either obtained z or t value

---

# Changes between the z-test and t-test

`$$S^2_{X} = \frac{\Sigma X^2 - \frac{(\Sigma X)^2}{N}}{N - 1}$$`

`$$S_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma X^2 - \frac{(\Sigma X)^2}{N}}{N - 1}}$$`

.pull-left[
`$$\sigma_{\overline{X}} = \frac{\sigma_{X}}{\sqrt{N}}$$`

`$$z_{obt} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{\sigma_{\overline{X}}}$$`
]

.pull-right[
`$$S_{\overline{X}} = \frac{S_{X}}{\sqrt{N}}$$`

`$$t_{obt} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{S_{\overline{X}}}$$`
]

---

# Small Change in Formulas

- SE calculation will start to look slightly different as it will use the variance squared

- Due to future formulas using slightly different notation, we will adopt that for our SE

`$$S_{\overline{X}} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2_{x}}{N}}$$`

# t-distribution &amp; Degrees of Freedom (df)

- we will now be working with the t-distribution
  - this also means we'll be working with a t-table
  
- **t-distribution** is the sampling distribution of all values of t when samples of a particular size (differing N size) are selected from the raw score population in the null hypothesis

---
  
# t-distribution &amp; Degrees of Freedom (df)

- higher values on the t-distribution are to the right of the population mean, lower values to the left of the population mean

- t-tests also have regions of rejection

- doesn't always represent a perfectly normal distribution
  - dependent on N value
  
    + larger the sample the more normal the distribution looks

- the different shapes are important because our regions of rejection will look different dependent on the sample size

---

# t-distribution &amp; Degrees of Freedom (df)

- the distribution changes based on the sample size, which then means that the 5% of the regions of rejection and critical value change

- remember to be conservative about estimating variance and SD, we have been using `N - 1`

- the name of that is the **degrees of freedom** or df
  - number of scores in a sample that reflect the variability in the population
  - determines shape of sampling distribution when estimating standard deviation for the population
  
---

# t-distribution &amp; Degrees of Freedom (df)

- since the df is the sample size - 1, the larger the df, the closer to resembling a normal distribution our data becomes
  - df of 120+ is the same as a z-distribution
  
---

# Using the t-table

- the t-table is different from the z-table

- has df, \alpha = .05 and \alpha = .01
  - this is dependent on our sample size - 1, and what our alpha is `a priori` 
  
---

# t-table

- we need to figure out our `t critical value`

- we need our sample size, and a decision on what alpha we want to use (.05 or .01)

- since not all df are listed, if your df is between two values, a statistically significant finding is a t-value larger than the larger df and smaller than the smaller df

---

# Examples

- sample size = 200
  - alpha = .05
  
- sample size = 90  
  - alpha = .05
  
- sample size = 37
  - alpha = .01

---

# t-test Interpretation

- If a statistically significant finding is found
  - your sample is significantly different from the population in whatever the outcome was

---

# One-tailed one-sample t-test

- if you know if your sample will do better or worse than the population, you'd use a one-tailed test
  
- Example: you know that your sample will get higher grades than the population

---

# Confidence Intervals

- **point estimation** is a way to estimate a point where you think the population's outcome value will be
  - this is why we can't say we're certain mu is a specific number and have to say *around* that number

- **interval estimation** is when we state that mu will fall within a range of values
  - margin of error, such as getting an exam and stating that the average test score was 84 plus or minus 3 points
    - due to sampling error
  
- **confidence intervals** are a range of values which we are certain our value falls within
  - when we say *around* a value, we are saying that we got one value but we are certain it is within a range of values
  - around 84 points on an exam, but we are certain the correct value is between 80 and 87
  
---

# Confidence Intervals

- We're choosing a range of values that are not significantly different from our sample mean

- we compute confidence intervals after we have a statistically significant finding

- It is often stated as:
  - We got a statistically significant finding where our sample scored ___ points compared to the population's score ___; *t*(df) = t-value, p-value
    - Example: *t*(31) = 4.7, p = .037

*t*(1070) = -36.39, *p* &lt; .05, 95% CI [81.87, 82.19]

Our one-sample t-test comparing a sample of coffee ratings (*M* = 82.03, *SD* = 2.67) to the population of coffee ratings (*M* = 85) showed evidence of a statistically significant difference. Specifically, the sample's average coffee rating was significantly lower than the population's average coffee rating; *t*(1070) = -36.39, *p* &lt; .05, 95% CI [81.87, 82.19]. We are 95% certain that the actual sample mean is between 81.87 and 82.19.

# Independent-samples t-test

---

# Between &amp; Within Designs

- Experiments can be broken down into two different types of designs

- **Between-subject/group** design is when you are interested in comparing two (for now) or more groups on an outcome variable

- **Within-subject/group** design is when you have the same participants but you test them twice (either with two different variables or two different time points)

---

# Two tests we are talking about

- **independent samples t-test** is when there are two groups of participants are separated into two different conditions to compare based on that condition
	- comparing the physical activity levels (DV) of sexes (Condition 1 = Male, Condition 2 = Female)
	- parametric test

- **paired-samples t-test** is when there are two experimental conditions that the same participants take part in
	- interested in two variables in the same sample of participants
	- can be the same variable and two different time points
	- bmi levels before an experiment and after the experiment for all participants
	- parametric test

---

# Independent Samples t-test

- JP note: probably the most often used t-test

- because it is a parametric test, it has assumptions

- Assumptions are
  - DV is normally distributed interval/ratio scores
  - populations have homogeneous variance
  - not a true assumption but something important to note is that your groups should be equal in `n` (condition) size
  
---

# Homogeneity of Variance

- **homogeneity of variance** is when the variances of the populations represented in a study have "equal" variances

- in order to test that the variances are equal, we can look at it through visuals
  - however, a better option is to use the Levene's test

---

# Independent samples t-test

- hypotheses are now focused on the differences between the two groups/conditions

`$$H0: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = 0$$`

H0: There will be no difference in DV scores between group 1 and group 2.
  - both samples/groups represent the population

`$$H1: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} \neq 0$$`

H1: There will be differences in DV scores between group 1 and group 2.
  - the groups represent a different population or don't represent the current population

---

# t-distribution for independent samples t-test

- we are interested in the difference between our group/sample means

- we have two samples from one raw score population 

- **sampling distribution of differences between means** show all differences between two means that occur when random samples are drawn from a population of scores

- the mean of the sampling distribution is zero because both sample means will equal the population mean of the raw score population

---

# Independent samples t-test

- determines the probability of obtaining our difference between our means when H0 is true

- Term changes
  - N is now the full sample size
  - n is the size of each group/sample/condition
    * so for each group/sample/condition, we have an n

# New Terms

- **pooled variance** is the weighted average variance of the groups'/samples' variances in a independent samples t-test

- **standard error of the difference** is the estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution of differences between the means

---

Now we can calculate the pooled variance
n1 = 10
n2 = 10
variance of group 1 = 2.5
variance of group 2 = 4.72

`$$S^2_{pool} = \frac{(n_{1} - 1)S^2_{1} + (n_{2} - 1)S^2_{2}}{(n_{1} - 1) + (n_{2} - 1)}$$`

---


```r
# start with the numerator

```
## [1] 64.98
```

```r
# numerator is 64.98

# denominator
(10 - 1) + (10 - 1)
```

```
## [1] 18
```

```r
# denominator is 18
```

`$$S^2_{pool} = \frac{(10 - 1)2.5 + (10 - 1)4.72}{(10 - 1) + (10 - 1)}$$`

---


```r
9*2.5 + 9*4.72
```

```
## [1] 64.98
```

```r
# 64.98

9+9
```

```
## [1] 18
```

```r
# 18
```

`$$S^2_{pool} = \frac{(9)2.5 + (9)4.72}{9 + 9}$$`

---


```r
64.98/18
```

```
## [1] 3.61
```

```r
# pooled variance is 3.61
```

`$$S^2_{pool} = \frac{64.98}{18}$$`

`$$S^2_{pool} = 3.61$$`

---

Let's calculate for the standard error of the difference

`$$S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{(S^2_{pool})(\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \frac{1}{n_{2}})}$$`

---


```r

```

```
## [1] 0.1
```

```r
3.61*(.1 + .1)
```

```
## [1] 0.722
```

```r
sqrt(.72)
```

```
## [1] 0.8485281
```

`$$S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{(3.61)(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10})}$$`

`$$S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{(3.61)(.1 + .1)}$$`
---


```r
3.61*(.1+.1)
```

```
## [1] 0.722
```

```r
# se is .72
```

`$$S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{.72}$$`

---


```r
sqrt(.72)
```

```
## [1] 0.8485281
```

```r
# se of the difference is .85
```
 
`$$S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = .85$$` 

---

Now we can calculate the independent samples t-test obtained value

`$$t_{obt} = \frac{(\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}) - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}}}$$`

**Note** the population mean 1 minus the population mean 2 is what is specified in the null hypothesis, so it will be zero


```r
((3.5 - 5.5) - 0)/.85
```

```
## [1] -2.352941
```

```r
# t obtained value is -2.35
```

`$$t_{obt} = \frac{(3.5 - 5.5) - 0}{.85}$$`

---

Let's now calculate the degrees of freedom

`$$df = (n_{1} - 1) + (n_{2} - 1)$$`
---


```r
(10 - 1) + (10 - 1)
```

```
## [1] 18
```

```r
# df is 18

# t critical is +-2.101
```

`$$df = (10 - 1) + (10 - 1)$$`

`$$df = 18$$`

---

So we get a value of -2.35 and the t-critical value is -2.101

Is there a statistically significant difference between the two groups?

--

-2.35 &gt; -2.101

---

Now let's get confidence intervals

`$$Lower\;Bound: (\overline{X}_{1} - \overline{X}_{2}) - t_{\alpha/2}\;*\;\sqrt{\frac{S^2_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{S^2_{2}}{n_{2}}}$$`

`$$Upper\;Bound: (\overline{X}_{1} - \overline{X}_{2}) + t_{\alpha/2}\;*\;\sqrt{\frac{S^2_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{S^2_{2}}{n_{2}}}$$`

---


```r
# group 1 mean = 3.5
# group 2 mean = 5.5
# t critical value is 2.101
# n1 = 10
# n2 = 10
# variance of group 1 = 2.5
# variance of group 2 = 4.72

# lower
(3.5 - 5.5) - 2.101 * sqrt((2.5/10) + (4.72/10))
```

```
## [1] -3.785232
```

```r
# -3.79

# upper
(3.5 - 5.5) + 2.101 * sqrt((2.5/10) + (4.72/10))
```

```
## [1] -0.214768
```

```r
# -.21
```

---

# Effect Sizes

- Reminder: r effect sizes are .1 = small, .3 = medium, .5 = large

- Reminder: cohen's d effect sizes are .2 = small, .5 = medium, .8 = large

- these are both measures of the strength of a relationship
  - better than simply using p value alone

- cohen's d can never be negative so the value you get is the absolute value (.e.g., its always positive)

- if unequal sample sizes in groups/conditions then you'll use `Hedges' g`
  - same formula and will be roughly the same once sample sizes get larger than 20 (N = 20)
  
---

`$$d = \frac{(\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}})}{\sqrt{S^2_{pool}}}$$`

Small sample sizes use the following formula (samples under 50)

`$$d = \frac{(\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}})}{\sqrt{S^2_{pool}}} * (\frac{N - 3}{N - 2.25}) * \sqrt{\frac{N - 2}{N}}$$`

---


```r
(3.5 - 5.5)/sqrt(3.61)
```

```
## [1] -1.052632
```

```r
# each step below
3.5 - 5.5
```

```
## [1] -2
```

```r
-2/sqrt(3.61)
```

```
## [1] -1.052632
```

```r
# cohen's d is .92 or the number of standard deviations between the means
```

`$$d = \frac{(3.5 - 5.5)}{\sqrt{3.61}}$$`

---


```r
(3.5 - 5.5)/sqrt(3.61)
```

```
## [1] -1.052632
```

```r
(10-3/10 -2.25)
```

```
## [1] 7.45
```

```r

```
## [1] 0.8944272
```

```r
-1.05*7.45*.89
```

```
## [1] -6.962025
```


`$$d = \frac{(3.5 - 5.5)}{\sqrt{3.61}} * (\frac{10 - 3}{10 - 2.25}) * \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2}{10}}$$`

# One-tail independent-samples t-test

- used when we are confident that the direction of the relationship

- if you think one group will have a higher score/value then you would make that statement in your alternative hypothesis

---

# Steps for one-tailed test

- Variable(Groups) = Intervention(Got Intervention/Control)
- Outcome = Fruit &amp; Vegetable Intake

1. decide which sample/group score you think will be larger
  - I think that the intervention group will eat more fruits and vegetables

2. decide which condition/group to subtract from the other
  - `intervention group - control group`

3. decide whether the difference will be positive or negative
  - a positive value should be returned from the previous equation
  
---

4. create hypotheses
  - The intervention group will eat the same or less fruits and vegetables than the control group
    - H0: mu(intervention group) - mu(control group) ≤ 0
  - The intervention group will eat more fruits and vegetables than the control group
    - H1: mu(intervention group) - mu(control group) &gt; 0
    
---

5. locate regions of rejection
  - since we are interested in a positive difference in our hypothesis, we'll only be looking at the upper tail of the distribution

6. conduct your independent samples t-test
  - make sure your groups/samples are subtracted the same way as your hypotheses
    - `intervention group - control group`

---

# Paired Samples t-test

- within-subjects/groups design

- also called related-samples t-test
  - each participant gets measured in each condition

- an example would be an intervention for weight loss where everyone's weight is measured before (first time point to measure) the intervention and after (second time point to measure)

- **matched-samples design** is when a participant in one condition is matched with a participant in the other condition

- **repeated-measures design** is when each participant gets measured twice
  - can be more for more rigorous statistics, but not the ones we'll learn about in this class

---

# Why we use paired-samples t-tests

- pretest/posttest design
  - before everyone gets the intervention/experiment (pretest or first time point) and then after the intervention/experiment (posttest or second time point)

---

- we subtract every person's before/after score from the before/score score to get a `difference` score

- you can subtract whatever score you want from the other (before - after or after - before)

- **mean differences** the mean of the differences between the paired scores
  - repesented as dbar

- add all the values of differences for before/after to get a sum and then divide by the number of participants (each person has a before and after score or the number of difference scores)

`$$Sample\;mean\;difference = \overline{D}$$`

`$$Population\;mean\;difference = \mu_{D}$$`

- now because we have a sample mean from a sample, we can now perform a one-sample t-test

---

# Hypotheses

- our null hypothesis is that there will be no change in scores on both occasions so there should be a difference of zero

`$$H_0: \mu_{D} = 0$$`

- our alternative hypothesis is that either our before or after scores should be higher
  - our hypothesis supports either a positive or negative change

`$$H_1: \mu_{D} \neq 0$$`

- similar to the independent samples t-test, our sampling distribution is of mean differences

---

# Steps to paired-samples t-test

Calculate the estimated variance of the difference scores

`$$S^2_{D} = \frac{\Sigma D^2 - \frac{(\Sigma D)^2}{N}}{N - 1}$$`

**Note** the notation changes from X to D because we are working with differences in scores and not means

---

Calculate the standard error of the mean differences

`$$S_{\overline{D}} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2_{D}}{N}}$$`

---

Find the obtained t-value

`$$t_{obt} = \frac{\overline{D} - \mu_{D}}{S_{\overline{D}}}$$`

The population difference will be zero unless you are testing for a nonzero difference

---

Calculate the degrees of freedom

`$$df = N - 1$$`

---

Calculate effect size

`$$d = \frac{\overline{D}}{\sqrt{S^2_{D}}}$$`

OR

`$$r^2_{pb} = \sqrt{\frac{(t_{obt})^2}{(t_{obt})^2 + df}}$$`
---

Discuss Significance

- Is the difference between time point 1 and time point 2 statistically significant?

---

`$$d = \frac{-2.24}{\sqrt{15.69}}$$`

---


```r
sqrt(15.69)
```

```
## [1] 3.96106
```

```r
sd(df$score_difference)

`$$d = -.57$$`

so really this means

`$$d = .57$$`

```r
(-1.79)^2
```

```
## [1] 3.2041
```

`$$r^2_{pb} = \sqrt{\frac{3.20}{3.20 + 9}}$$`

---


```r
3.20 + 9
```

```
## [1] 12.2
```

`$$r^2_{pb} = \sqrt{\frac{3.20}{12.20}}$$`

---


```r
3.2/12.2
```

```
## [1] 0.2622951
```

`$$r^2_{pb} = \sqrt{.26}$$`

---


```r
sqrt(.26)
```

```
## [1] 0.509902
```

`$$r^2_{pb} = .51$$`

## Discuss Significance

t-obtained value of -1.79

t-critical value of 

---

# One-tailed paired-samples t-test

- choose whether you think your `after` score would be lower/higher than the `before` score

- have your hypotheses reflect that

- if you think after scores should be higher than before (learning intervention) then the difference scores should be positive
  - because you subtracted before scores from after scores

`$$H_{a}: \mu_{D} &gt; 0$$`

`$$H_{0}: \mu_{D} \leq 0$$`

---

# Reporting

- report in a similar style to all other t-test
  - t(df) = t value, p value
  
- you'll also report the means of the before and after scores
  - you won't report the difference between the two means
  
---

# Effect Sizes

- **effect size** is the amount of influence that changing the conditions of the IV has on the DV

- **cohen's d** is a measure of effect size in two-sample studies that reflects the magnitude of difference

  - small = .2
  
  - medium = .5
  
  - large = .8

- larger effect size means stronger the strength of the association/relationship between the IV and DV

---

# Effect Size using Proportion of Variance Accounted For

- used to determine how consistently scores change

- **proportion of variance accounted for** is the proportion of differences in DV scores assocaited with changing the conditions of the IV
  - effect size using **squared point-biserial correlation coefficient**, which indicates the proprotion of variance in DV scores that is accounted fro by IV variable in two-sample studies, are below
  
    - small = .09
    
    - moderate = .10-.25
    
    - large = .25

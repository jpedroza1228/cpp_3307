11. Answer what type of statistical test you would conduct based on the prompt below.

You are interested in knowing more about college satisfaction levels. You ask a small sample to rate their experiences on a scale of 1 (being not at all satisfied) to 10 (as satisfied as possible). You decide to sample 10 students to compare to the rest of the university to see if your sample is any different. You know that the average satisfaction rating is 7.4 for the whole university. Knowing this, you are interested in knowing whether your sample is more or less satisfied with their college experience.

Below is the information if using R.

q11_values = c(10, 5, 7, 6, 3, 9, 7, 8, 4, 5)

A. independent-samples t-test

B. paired-samples t-test

C. one-way ANOVA

D. z-test

**E.** one-sample t-test

12. Calculate the sample mean for the test chosen above.

13. Calculate the variance for the test chosen above.

14. Calculate the standard error for the test chosen above.

**B.** FALSE

17. Answer what type of statistical test you would conduct based on the prompt below.

You are interested in comfort levels of different types of footwear. You have 4 different types of footwear that you are interested in testing; flip flops, sneakers, heavy rain boots, and slippers. In addition to the four different types of footwear, you also have a control group that is barefoot. You have all your participants go about their normal day but no matter what they do they must only use the type of footwear they have been assigned. At the end of your experiment, you give out a short survey from your participants about their comfort levels. Below is the information they provide. You are especially interested in how the barefoot group did compared to the other groups. Questions 17-25 are all related to this question.

If using R, below is what you can run.

footwear <- data.frame(flip_flops = c(6, 6, 7, 4, 6, 5),
                    shoes = c(8, 9, 6, 7, 7, 8),
                    boots = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3),
                    slippers = c(3, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4),
                    barefoot = c(2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2))

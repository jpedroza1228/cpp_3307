# Post-hoc Tests

- **Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference)** is a post hoc test for ANOVA to compare mean for each level in a factor
  - used only when the `ns` in each level of the factor are equal
  
- it computes the the minimum difference between two means that is required for them to be significantly different

- Bonferroni Correction
  - based on your alpha, you get that value and divide by the number of tests you need to conduct

# Tukey Steps

1. Find `q_{k}`, which are values of studentized range statistic
  - We'll come back to studentized values
  - locate the `k`
  - find the `df_{wm}`

2. Compute the HSD
  
`$$HSD = (q_{k})(\sqrt{\frac{MS_{wn}}{n}})$$`

---

3. Determine the differences between each pair of means

4. Compare each difference between means to the Tukey HSD value
  - if the absolute difference between two means is greater than the HSD then these differences are significantly different
    
    + similar to a independent samples t-test with a significant t-obtained value

---

# Example from last slides

MS within = 7
n = 5

For `q_{k}`, we need k and `df_{wn}`
df_wn = 12
k = 3
q_k = 3.77


```r
3.77*(sqrt(7/5))
```

```
## [1] 4.460724
```

---

Our Tukey HSD is `4.46`

So now we compare the means of our three groups/levels


```r
8 - 6 # easy - medium
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
8 - 3 # easy - hard
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
6 - 3 # medium - hard
```

```
## [1] 3
```

2 &lt; 4.46
5 &gt; 4.46
3 &lt; 4.46

So only the difference between easy and the hard groups was a statistically significant finding at an alpha of .05

---

# Effect Size

- cohen's d only really used for two-sample designs (t-tests)

- rather, for ANOVA and regression, we will rely on **Proportion of variance accounted for**
  - there are better effect sizes (most would argue that proportion of variance accounted for in regression models is not an effect size)

- greater the eta squared, the more that our IV accounts for the DV

- eta squared is the same as R squared

- **eta squared** is the proportion of variance in the DV that is accounted for with the change in levels in the factor/IV

---

# Formula

`$$\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{bn}}{SS_{total}}$$`

- SS between is the differences between all the scores in the experiment
  - it is also what we know our model is actually looking at
  
- because it is proportion, we can easily interpret it as the percentage that the change in groups/levels accounts for the DV score difference

`$$ANOVA:\;eta^{squared} = \eta^2$$`

`$$Regression:\;R^2$$`

---

# ANCOVA

- conceptually the same thing as ANOVA but it includes covariates/control variables

- ANCOVA = Analysis of Covariance

- The same thing as multiple regression

- You are still interested in differences between levels on your DV values, but now you include additional variables to help account for some of the variance in your DV

# Context

You are trying out four different methods for helping participants with their depression. You decide to give out: medication only, individual therapy, group, and medication and individual therapy. Below are each level's depression levels at the end of the experiment. You are interested in a difference between the four groups. 


```r
data &lt;- data.frame(meds = c(4, 5, 4, 6, 5),
                   ind_therapy = c(5, 4, 3, 5, 5),
                   group = c(8, 8, 6, 9, 10),
                   med_ind = c(3, 1, 3, 2, 1))

data
```

```
##   meds ind_therapy group med_ind
## 1    4           5     8       3
## 2    5           4     8       1
## 3    4           3     6       3
## 4    6           5     9       2
## 5    5           5    10       1
```

# Hypotheses

H0: There will be no differences between the therapeutic approaches

H1: There will be differences between the therapeutic approaches

Even better,

H1: The group that receives medication and individual therapy will have significantly better or worse depression rates than every other group.

  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode

# Quick Note

The book goes over this kind of fast, so I'm going to use additional materials to hopefully better explain these topics

---

# Frequencies

- **raw score** is the score given to a participant

- **Frequency** denoted as f; number of times a score occurs/is counted
  - *Note.* Not F, that is something completely different. 

- **Frequency Distribution** is a distribution of each score and the number of times the score has occurred/is counted
  - often viewed through a **histogram**, or a plot that has the observations on the x-axis and the count/number of times a score has occurred on the y-axis

---

# Frequency Distributions

- the most common frequency distribution is the **normal distribution/normal curve**
  - where the number of scores are equal on both sides if a line down the middle is drawn

---

# Normal Distribution

.pull-left[
- **Normal curve** is often called the bell-shaped curve; is symmetrical

- represents the population because if you have enough data you will get a normal distribution (central limit theorem)
  - if your data looks like this in a histogram, you're in good shape
  
- **Distribution Tail** are the ends of a histogram/normal distribution
  - has two tails
]

# Normal Distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
skew %>% 
  ggplot(aes(normal)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "gray70", color = "white", bins = 20, alpha = .8) +
  labs(x = '')
```

- Skewed Distributions
  - Some thresholds are that if you have a skewness value of +-2 or +-3 then you're good to use that variable like it is.

---

# Skewed Distributions

.pull-left[
- **Negative Skew** is like a finger pointing left
  - not normal and is asymmetrical
  - indicates higher frequency of middle and higher scores
  - no low frequency in higher scores
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
skew %>% 
  ggplot(aes(neg_skew)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "gray70", color = "white", bins = 20, alpha = .8) +
  labs(x = '')
```
]

---

# Skewed Distributions

.pull-left[
- **Positive Skew** is like a finger pointing right
  - not normal and is asymmetrical
  - indicates higher frequency of low and middle scores
  - no low frequency in lower scores
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
skew %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pos_skew)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "gray70", color = "white", bins = 20, alpha = .8) +
  labs(x = '')
```
]
---

# Kurtosis

- **Kurtosis** can be thought of as the pointyness of your distribution

- a **leptokurtic** distribution is reflective of positive kurtosis
  - extremely pointy
  
- a **platykurtic** distribution is reflective of negative kurtosis
  - extremely flat

---

# Bimodal Distributions

- **Bimodal Distribution** is when your distribution has two modes (two highest points on a plot)
  - means that there are two areas of your distribution with higher frequencies of scores

- **Multimodal Distributions** are when your distribution has more than two modes (three or more highest points on a plot)
  - means that there are multiple areas of your distribution with higher frequencies of scores

---

# Distribution Examples

# Some Notes From JP

- Deciding what is positively and negatively skewed from visuals alone is not good enough

- You'll want to look into your descriptive statistics and look at skewness and kurtosis to make sure they are within +-3

- Some statistics can handle some skewness and kurtosis

- Other times you'll have to transform the variable using fancy methods that we will not talk about in this class.

---

# Relative Frequency

- **Relative Frequency** the proportion of times a score occurred/is counted in the distribution

$$Relative\;frequency = f/N$$

- `f` is the frequency of one category of a categorical variable. `N` is the total number of observations for all the categories of that variable. 

- **cumulative frequency** is the number of scores in the data at or below a particular score
  - add up the frequencies that make up that part of the histogram
---

# Relative Frequency

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
freq_ex <- c(3, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3)
freq_ex
```

$$Count\;of\;3 = f/N$$
--

$$Count\;of\;3 = 3/6$$

--

$$Relative\;Frequency = 3/6 = .50$$

--

$$Percentage = 3/6 = .50*100 = 50\%$$

---

# Histogram Visual

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
freq_df <- as_tibble(freq_ex) 

ggplot(freq_df, aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 'white', fill = 'dodgerblue', bins = 5)
```

---

# Terminology

$$\Sigma = Sum\;of\;scores$$

$$\Sigma X = Sum\;Of\;X$$

---

# Measures of Central Tendency

- **Measures of Central Tendency** are statistics that summarize the location of a distribution on a variable by indicating where the center is

- A Normal distribution will have the central point right down the center

- A skewed distribution will have the central point where the frequency of scores is the highest

---

# Measures of Central Tendency

- **mean**
  - an average score
  - sum of the scores divided by the number of observations

- **median**
  - middle value of a distribution when scores are ranked from lowest to highest

- **mode**
  - value(s) with the highest frequency

---

# Mode

]

.pull-right[
- Value/score with the highest frequency

- Not used in inferential statistics, mainly for descriptive statistics

- useful for telling whether a distribution is bimodal/multimodal or normal
]

---

# Median

- will be the middle of the distribution
  - the 50% percentile

- median can be very useful for unusual data

- the symbol in literature is sometimes

- *Important Note* If you have an even number of scores/values, then you will add the two middle values and divide by 2

$$Mdn = Median$$

---

# Median in Action

### Values

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
median_values <- c(1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 6)
median_values2 <- c(1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 6, 4)

median_values
median_values2
```

### Sorted Values 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
sort(median_values)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
sort(median_values2)
```

### Calculation for Even Number of Values

```{r}
(3+4)/2
```

Medians are 3 for odd numbers and 3.5 for even numbers in this example.

# Mean

- is the score located at the `mathematical` center of a distribution

- `Xbar` is often used for the mean

- two formula examples below

- Calculate the mean for interval and ratio scales
  - The mean of ordinal/ordered data makes no sense
  
- Basis for most `inferential statistics`

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$$

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\Sigma X}{n}$$

---

# Using the Mean

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
set.seed(02012022)
mean_ex <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 7, sd = 2)
round(mean_ex, 2)
```

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$$

---

$$\overline{X} = \frac{(9.17+4.03+6.82+0.56+7.36+9.06+8.26+7.77+8.97+10.92)}{10}$$

```{r}
(9.17+4.03+6.82+0.56+7.36+9.06+8.26+7.77+8.97+10.92)
# total is 72.92
```

---

$$\overline{X} = \frac{72.92}{10}$$

```{r}
72.92/10
# mean is 7.29
```

---

$$\overline{X} = 7.29$$

---

# When The Median Shines

.pull-left[
![ugly and proud](https://media.giphy.com/media/qdBHt01vnl972/giphy.gif)
]

.pull-right[
- Preferred for ordinal/ordered data

- Not the best option for normally distributed interval & ratio scores

- Is more reliable when dealing with skewed data
  - The mean will be pulled toward the extreme tail of the distribution
]

# The Mean in Research

* Most statistics revolve around the mean

* Can't just trust descriptive statistics like the mean

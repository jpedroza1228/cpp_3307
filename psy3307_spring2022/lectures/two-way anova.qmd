## Factorial Design

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(emmeans)

small_cars <- mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl != 8) %>% 
  mutate(cyl = recode(cyl,
                      '4' = '0',
                      '6' = '1')) %>% 
  select(mpg, cyl, am)

```

-   factorial designs are often also referred to as two-way ANOVA

-   JP: I like to draw out my factorial ANOVAs because it also helps with understanding means

    -   a two-way ANOVA has 2 IVs as well as an interaction (we'll talk about this shortly)

        -   they can often be written out as the number of variables and the number of levels/conditions per variable

        -   Ex: penguins (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) and sex (Male and Female) would be a 3 x 2 (Three by Two) Factorial Design

        -   Ex: Intervention (Control, Physical Activity, Physical Activity + Eating Habits) and method of delivery (Online and In-person) would be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

        -   Ex: Intervention (Control and Treatment) and Age (Young Adult, Adult, Older Adult) and Sex (Male and Female) would be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

    -   an ANCOVA can have two variables, with one being a covariate, but will not include an interaction

## Factorial Design

-   **independent factorial design** has several IVs/predictors comparing different groups

    -   between-subjects design

-   **repeated-measures factorial design** has several IVs/predictors that have been measured where all participants receive all conditions

    -   within-subjects design

-   **mixed design** has several IVs/predictors with some measuring all participants over all conditions while also examining different groups

    -   Ex: pretest-posttest while comparing whether or not participants meet a MDD diagnosis

    -   one IV is between-subjects and the other IV is a within-subjects variable

## Independent Factorial Design

-   the best way of deciphering ANOVAs are by what precedes the word ANOVA

    -   **one**-way ANOVA

    -   **two**-way independent ANOVA

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
Y_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1i} + b_{2}X_{2i} + ... + b_{n}X_{ni} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

-   let's talk cars

    -   variables = number of cylinders and transmission type

        -   levels = 4 vs 6 cylinder (we'll leave out 8 cylinder for the example)

        -   levels = manual vs automatic

## Independent Factorial Design

-   SPSS does not require dummy coding for ANOVA but you can run the same test in a linear regression with dummy coded variables and get the same estimates

    -   we'll have reference groups for each variable

$$
MPG_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Cylinder_{1i} + b_{2}Transmission_{2i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

-   however, the model above is not a two-way ANOVA

    -   it lacks one core component (right now it's only an ANCOVA)

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
MPG_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Cylinder_{1i} + b_{2}Transmission_{2i} + b_{3}Interaction_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
MPG_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Cylinder_{1i} + b_{2}Transmission_{2i} + 
$$

$$
b_{3}Cylinder*Transmission_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

-   the **interaction** term is the combined (multiplied) effect of cylinder and transmission type on MPG

## Independent Factorial Design

-   let's now look at the *b* values

```{r}
small_cars
```

## Independent Factorial Design

-   combinations we'll have are:

    -   4-cylinder (coded = 0) and automatic (coded = 0)

        -   Average MPG = 22.9, SD = 1.45

    -   4-cylinder (coded = 0) and manual (coded = 1)

        -   Average MPG = 28.1, SD = 4.48

    -   6-cylinder (coded = 1) and automatic (coded = 0)

        -   Average MPG = 19.1, SD = 1.63

    -   6-cylinder (coded = 1) and manual (coded = 1)

        -   Average MPG = 20.6, SD = 0.75

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
MPG_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}Cylinder_{1i} + b_{2}Transmission_{2i} + 
$$

$$
b_{3}Cylinder*Transmission_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
X_{4, automatic}= b_{0} + (b_{1} * 0) + (b_{2} * 0) + (b_{3} * 0) + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
b_{0} = X_{4, automatic}
$$

$$
b_{0} = 22.9
$$

-   $b_0$ will be the average MPG for cars that are a **4-cylinder** car and have an **automatic** transmission

## Independent Factorial Design

-   now we can look at when we have a 6-cylinder car

$$
X_{6, automatic}= b_{0} + (b_{1} * 1) + (b_{2} * 0) + (b_{3} * 0) + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
= b_{0} + b_{1}
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
= X_{4, automatic} + b_{1}
$$

$$
b_{1} = X_{6, automatic} - X_{4, automatic}
$$

$$
b_{1} = 19.1 - 22.9
$$

$$
b_{1} = -3.8
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

-   $b_1$ is the average difference between a for **6-cylinder** cars that have an **automatic** transmission and **4-cylinder** cars that are **automatic**

## Independent Factorial Design

-   Let's now move on to $b2$

$$
X_{4, manual}= b_{0} + (b_{1} * 0) + (b_{2} * 1) + (b_{3} * 0) + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
= b_{0} + b_{2}
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
= X_{4, automatic} + b_{2}
$$

$$
b_{2} = X_{4, manual} - X_{4, automatic}
$$

$$
b_{2} = 28.1 - 22.9
$$

$$
b_{2} = 5.2
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

-   $b_{2}$ is the average difference between **4-cylinder** cars that are **manual** and **4-cylinder** cars that are **automatic**

## Independent Factorial Design

-   Finally, let's focus on the **interaction,** or the multiplied terms of cylinder and transmission

$$
X_{6, manual} = b_{0} + (b_{1} * 1) + (b_{2} * 1) + (b_{3} * 1) + \epsilon_{i}
$$

$$
= b_{0} + b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3}
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
= X_{4, automatic} + (X_{6, automatic} - X_{4, automatic}) + (X_{4, manual} - X_{4, automatic}) + b_{3}
$$

$$
= X_{6, automatic} + X_{4, manual} - X_{4, automatic}
$$

$$
b_{3} = X_{4, automatic} - X_{6, automatic}  + X_{6, manual} - X_{4, manual}
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

$$
b_{3} = 22.9 - 19.1 + 20.6 - 28.1
$$

$$
b_{3} = 3.8 + (-7.5)
$$

$$
b_{3} = -3.7
$$

## Independent Factorial Design

```{r}
summary(lm(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl)*as.factor(am),
           data = small_cars))
```

## Independent Factorial Design

```{r, echo = FALSE}
small_cars %>%
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl),
         am = as.factor(am),
         cyl = recode(cyl, '0' = '4-cyl',
                      '1' = '6-cyl'),
         am = recode(am, '0' = 'automatic',
                     '1' = 'manual')) %>% 
  group_by(cyl, am) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg),
            sd_mpg = sd(mpg)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  drop_na(cyl, am, mean_mpg, sd_mpg) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cyl, mean_mpg, group = am)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = am)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = am)) +
  annotate(geom = 'text',
           label = 'b0',
           x = .9,

           color = 'red',
           size = 8) + 
  theme_light()
```

## Independent Factorial Design

-   the interaction shows us the difference between automatic and manual transmissions when comparing 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder cars in their average MPG

-   from the findings, we can conclude

    -   a difference between 4-cylinder cars and 6-cylinder cars in average MPG?

    -   a difference between automatic and manual transmission cars in average MPG?

    -   a difference in average MPG between 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder cars is dependent on whether or not a car has an automatic or manual transmission?

## Behind the Scenes of Factorial Designs

![](images/paste-736A9802.png)

## Behind the Scenes of Factorial Designs

-   calculations are very similar to a one-way ANOVA

    -   model sum of squares is now broken up into

        -   what is explained from our first IV

        -   what is explained from our second IV

        -   what is explained by the interaction between $IV_{1}$ and $IV_{2}$

## Total Sum of Squares

$$
SS_{T} = \sum^N_{i = 1}(x_{i} - \overline{X}_{grand})^2
$$

$$
SS_{T} = S^2_{grand}(N - 1)
$$

-   N is still the number of participants in our sample

## Model Sum of Squares

$$
SS_{M} = \sum^k_{g = 1} n_{g}(\overline{X}_{g} - \overline{X}_{grand})^2
$$

-   we are still looking at what the variance our model explains in our outcome

-   using the car data from before, we could find the model sum of squares by using the 2 levels of cylinder (4-cyl and 6-cyl) and the 2 levels of transmission (automatic and manual)

    -   the mean of each group and subtract the grand mean from it

-   degrees of freedom for the model would still follow the same formula $df_{M} = k - 1$, so since we have 2 levels for both variables we would have 4 different groups

## Main Effect of $IV_1$

$$
SS_{A} = \sum^k_{g = 1} n_{g}(\overline{X}_{g} - \overline{X}_{grand})^2
$$

-   common letters for the main effects are $A$ and $B$ with the interaction being $A*B$

-   if our first variable is cylinder, then we would use the means for all cars that are a 4-cylinder and all cars that are a 6-cylinder **independent** of whether these cars have a manual or automatic transmission

    -   only focusing on cylinder types for the main effect of cylinder on MPG

-   df for this main effect would still be $k - 1$, but now we are only focusing on our two cylinder groups so it would now be $2 - 1 = 1$

## Main Effect of $IV_2$

$$
SS_{B} = \sum^k_{g = 1} n_{g}(\overline{X}_{g} - \overline{X}_{grand})^2
$$

-   we'll now do the same thing for transmission types (automatic and manual) **independent** of how many cylinders are car has

## Interaction of $IV_1 * IV_2$

-   the easiest way of calculating the sum of squares for the interaction is by using the information we already have

$$
SS_{A*B} = SS_{M} - SS_{A} - SS_{B}
$$

-   the degrees of freedom could be calculated the same way

$$
df_{A*B} = df_{M} - df_{A} - df_{B}
$$

## Residual Sum of Squares

-   we can calculate the residual sum of squares the same way we did when conducting a one-way ANOVA

$$
SS_{R} = SS_{T} - SS_{M}
$$

-   remember that at this point, we already calculated the $SS_T$ and the $SS_M$ so we can use this formula to get the variance not explained by our model

$$
SS_{R} = \sum^k_{g = 1}S^2_{g}(n_{g} - 1)
$$

-   our you can use this formula to get the variance of each group and add them all together

## The F-statistic

-   the only difference between a factorial ANOVA and a one-way ANOVA is that, we will now calculate three different mean squares values for the model and the residual mean squares

    $$
    MS_{A} = \frac{SS_A}{df_A}
    $$

$$
MS_{B} = \frac{SS_B}{df_B}
$$

$$
MS_{A*B} = \frac{SS_{A*B}}{df_{A*B}}
$$

$$
MS_{R} = \frac{SS_{R}}{df_{R}}
$$

## The F-statistic

-   we will also calculate F statistics for both main effects and the interaction

    -   since these F tests are all signal-to-noise ratios, we will use the residual mean squares for the noise of each test

$$
F_A = \frac{MS_A}{MS_R}
$$

$$
F_B = \frac{MS_B}{MS_R}
$$

$$
F_{A*B} = \frac{MS_{A*B}}{MS_R}
$$

## The F-statistic

```{r, echo = FALSE}
aov_model <- aov(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl)*as.factor(am),
                 data = small_cars)
summary(aov_model)

small_cars %>%
  group_by(cyl, am) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg),
            sd_mpg = sd(mpg)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

## Model Assumptions

-   if you violate the assumption of homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity), SPSS will struggle to correct for the assumption with anything more than a $2 x 2$ design

    -   one way to get around this is to bootstrap your post-hoc tests

-   we'll look at the residuals and predicted values

-   we'll test for normality

## Simple Effects Analysis

-   one way to break down interactions is through the use of **simple effects analysis**

    -   examines the effect/relationship of one IV at individual levels of the other IV

    -   Ex: cylinder --> MPG for automatic cars; cylinder --> MPG for manual cars

-   we'll talk about how to conduct simple effect analyses in SPSS syntax

    -   which we'll talk about today

## Interpreting Interaction Graphs

-   "a picture is worth a thousand words"

-   if a significant interaction is found, then we would state that the relationship between cylinder and MPG is dependent on what type of transmission a car has

## Interpreting Interaction Graphs

```{r}
small_cars %>%
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl),
         am = as.factor(am),
         cyl = recode(cyl, '0' = '4-cyl',
                      '1' = '6-cyl'),
         am = recode(am, '0' = 'automatic',
                     '1' = 'manual')) %>% 
  group_by(cyl, am) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg),
            sd_mpg = sd(mpg)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  drop_na(cyl, am, mean_mpg, sd_mpg) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cyl, mean_mpg, group = am)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = am)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = am)) +
  theme_light()
```

## Interpreting Interaction Graphs

-   non-parallel lines indicate some degree of an interaction

    -   Note: this does not mean non-parallel lines always show a statistically significant interaction

-   interaction plots that cross are non-parallel and could indicate a possible statistically significant interaction

    -   Note: the visual/plot can tell us that there may be a significant interaction; however, only our F-test for the interaction will tell us if the interaction is significant or not

## Interpreting Interaction Graphs

-   SPSS allows for bar plots or line plots

    -   both are not the prettiest but line plots are easier to read (for me personally)

    -   you can also include error bars (which is best practice) but for our assignments i will not because it clutters SPSS output

```{r}
summary(aov_model)
```

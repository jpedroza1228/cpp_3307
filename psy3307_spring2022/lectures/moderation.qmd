## Conceptual Model

-   conceptually the term is moderation, but its an interaction in statistical terms

    -   still the multiplied effect between two IVs

-   moderation models allow us to see if there are differences between your predictor and your outcome by a second predictor (**moderator variable**)

    -   the moderator affects the relationship between your IV and your DV

        -   Ex: you can examine the differences in depression ($DV$) between BMI categories ($IV_1$) and whether they differ based on race/ethnicity ($IV_2$)

        -   Ex: you can examine if there are differences by BMI category ($IV_2$) on the relationship between smartphone use ($IV_1$) and depression ($DV$)

        -   Ex: you can examine if there are differences in the relationship between smartphone use ($IV_1$) and depression ($DV$) by level of email use ($IV_2$)

## Conceptual Model

-   when we have two continuous variables, we are looking at the relationship between the predictor and your outcome based on chosen levels of your moderator

    -   it tends to be +1 and -1 SD for low and high levels of your moderator

-   when we look at a continuous predictor and a categorical moderator, we will look at the relationship between the predictor and the outcome compared by groups

## Statistical Model

$$
Y_i = (b_0 + b_1X_{1i} + b_2X_{2i} + b_3X_{3i} + b_nX_{ni}) + \epsilon_i 
$$

$$
Stress_i = (b_0 + b_1Smartphone_i + b_2Email_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

$$
Stress_i = (b_0 + b_1Smartphone_i + b_2Email_i + b_3SmartphoneXEmail_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

## Centering Variables

-   $b$ values represent the slope and should be different from zero in order to reject the null hypothesis

-   sometimes the interpretation of your predictors would not make sense at a value of zero

    -   Book: you can't have zero heart rate

-   Centering is used to redefine the zero point

    -   also called **grand mean centering**, because centering is often subtracting the mean from your variable

    -   shifts the scale over but retains the unit interpretation

    -   the slope won't change between predictor and outcome

## Centering Variables

$$
Email_{center} = Email - \overline{X}_{Email}
$$

-   centered values are centered on zero but are slightly different from z-scores

    -   centered values are not expressed as standard deviation units (like z-scores)

-   centering won't really affect interpretation of the interaction

    -   it does affect interpretation of "main effects" relationships between predictors and outcome

    -   these relationships are no longer the $b$ values when the other variable(s) are zero

        -   they are now the relationship when the other variable(s) are at their mean

-   Ex: $b_1$ would be the relationship between smartphone use and stress when emailing is at its average

## Centering Variables

-   centering with an interaction makes "main effects" more interpretable, especially with non-significant interactions

-   two interpretations are possible for the "main effects"

    -   the effect of that predictor at the mean value of the sample

    -   the average effect of that predictor across the range of scores for the other predictors

## Creating Interaction Variables

-   categorical variables will need dummy coding

-   continuous variables could be centered

-   then you create a term that multiples the two variables of interest

    -   for continuous and categorical variable interactions and categorical and categorical interactions --> you will use each dummy coded variable to make interactions

## Simple Slopes Analyses

-   if you have a significant interaction then you must conduct simple slopes analyses

    -   significant interactions only tell us at differing levels of our moderator, there is a significant relationship between predictor and outcome

-   we may be interested in the relationship between our predictor and outcome at **high levels** and **low levels** of your moderator

    -   this is often at +1 and -1 standard deviations from the centered mean

        -   you could use more meaningful values for your moderator, these are just the norm

        -   you could also run the interaction at all the varying levels of the moderator rather than just two points

        -   **Johnson-Neyman intervals**

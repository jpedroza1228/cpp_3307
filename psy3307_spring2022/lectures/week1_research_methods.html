# Agenda

- 

---

# Designs

* **Design** is how a study is organized

- Experimental (manipulate your independent variable to see what effect it has on the dependent variable)
  - True Experiment
  - Quasi Experiment
  - Natural Experiment
  
- Correlational (don't manipulate anything; just look at the relationship between two variables)
  - Correlation
  - Regression

---

# Differences in Population &amp; Sample

- **Population** is a large group of individuals, which a law of nature applies

- **Sample** is a group of a given population intended to represent that population

- **Participants** are those measured in a sample. Participants always refers to individuals (e.g., students, children, prisoners)

- A sample is *supposed to generalize* to a given population

- We never use subjects in the social sciences anymore, they are participants

---

# Statistics vs Parameters

- **Statistics** use English letters to get values for a sample 

- **Parameter** use greek letters for values of a population

Statistic = Sample

Parameter = Population

---

# Straight into Terms

- **raw score** is the score given to a participant

- **Frequency** denoted as f; number of times a score occurs/is counted

*Note.* Not F, that is something completely different. 

- **Frequency Distribution** is a distribution of each score and the number of times the score has occurred/is counted

---

# Visualizing Frequencies

- Best way of visualizing frequencies is by using a bar graph

- **Bar graph** graph with vertical bar over each nominal/ordinal category

- **Side Note** A pie graph will always be inferior to a bar graph/any other visual

- **Histogram** is a frequency graph used for interval or ratio scores

- **Frequency Polygon** similar to a histogram, which shows data points connected with straight lines 

- **Grouped Distributions** put continuous data into categories
  - The next slide has data ranging from 6-10 in coffee uniformity; I could lump them as anything below a perfect 10 (6-9) and then 10 as a different category

---

# Normal Distribution

![paranormal distribution](https://jech.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/jech/60/1/6/embed/graphic-1.gif)

---

# Why Is It a Normal Distribution?

- **Normal curve** is often called the bell-shaped curve; is symmetrical

- **Normal Distribution** same thing as normal curve; represents the population because if you have enough data you will get a normal distribution (central limit theorem); if your data looks like this in a histogram, you're in good shape

- **Distribution Tail** has two tails; these will be more important for statistics

---

# Skewed Distributions

- **Negative Skew** is like a finger pointing left; not normal and is asymmetrical; indicates higher frequency of middle and higher scores; no low frequency in higher scores

- **Positive Skew** is like a finger pointing right; not normal and is asymmetrical; indicates higher frequency of low and middle scores; no low frequency in lower scores

- Some thresholds are that if you have a skewness value of +-2 or +-3 then you're good to use that variable like it is.

- **Kurtosis** is when your frequency are really skinny and tall or really flat and wide

---

# Bimodal Distribution

- **Bimodal Distribution** is when your distribution has two humps with a valley in the middle; high frequencies both below and above the middle of the plot

---

# Some Notes From JP

Deciding what is positively and negatively skewed from visuals alone is not good enough

You'll want to look into your descriptive statistics and look at skewness and kurtosis to make sure they are within +-3

Some statistics can handle some skewness and kurtosis

Other times you'll have to transform the variable using fancy methods that we will not talk about in this class.

---

# Relative Frequency

* **Relative Frequency** the proportion of times a score occures/is counted in the distribution

$$ Relative\;frequency = f/N$$

Here, f is the frequency of one category of a nominal variable. N is the total number of observations for all the categories of that variable. 


```r
f = 37
N = 2000

relative_frequency = f/N
relative_frequency
```

```
## [1] 0.0185
```

```r
percent = relative_frequency*100
percent
```

```
## [1] 1.85
```

---

# Relative Frequency Using Normal Curve

- **Proportion of Area under the Curve** is the proportion of total area under the normal curve

- **Percentile** is the percentage of all scores in the sample below a particular score

- **Cumulative Frequency** is the number of scores in the data at or below a particular score

---

# Greek Terms

`$$\Sigma = Sum\;of\;scores$$`

`$$\Sigma\;X = Sum\;Of\;X$$`

---

# Greek Terms

- Both of these are stating that we are adding all of the data points together.

- **Sum of X** is the sum of the scores in a sample
  - X is just another way to say all the data points for the variable.

---

# Central Tendency

* Concept that as statisticians every person is just a data point

* We are interested in the central score
  - We are interested in how much a person is away from that central score
  - But when it comes to statistics we like to group together our participants' scores/values
  
* **Measures of Central Tendency** are statistics that summarize the location of a distribution on a variable by indicating where the center is

* A Normal distribution will have the central point right down the center

* A skewed distribution will have the central point where the frequency of scores is the highest

---

# The Mode

.pull-left[
![](https://i.imgflip.com/prj6o.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
* Value/score with the highest frequency

* Essentially useless in statistics

* **Unimodal distributions** distribution with only one hump; one value is the mode

* **Bimodal distributions** distribution with two humps; two values with the highest frequency; two modes

---

# The Median

.pull-left[
![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/033/395/Thumbnail_expert_micro.png)
]

.pull-right[
* **Median** is the middle value/score; the 50th percentile

* Unlike the mode, it will always be close to the middle of a distribution

* You'll only ever have one median

* The symbol is:
`$$Mdn = Median$$`
]

---

# The Median

* Preferred for ordinal/ordered data

* Not the best option for normally distributed interval &amp; ratio scores

* Is more reliable when dealing with skewed data

* *Important Note* If you have an even number of scores/values, then you will add the two middle values and divide by 2

---

# The Mean/Average

* **Mean** is the score located at the `mathematical` center of a distribution

* Xbar is often used for the mean
  - $$ \overline{X} $$ 

* $$\overline{X} = \frac{\Sigma\;X}{N} $$ is the formula to calculate the mean.
  - Xbar is the Sum of X/Scores divided by the total number of observations/scores/values

* Calculate the mean for interval and ratio scales
  - The mean of ordinal/ordered data makes no sense
  
* Basis for most `inferential statistics`

---

# When to Use Each Measure

* The Median more accurately describes/summarizes skewed data compared to the mean
  - The mean will be pulled toward the extreme tail of the distribution
  
* Normal distribution then use the mean as the best measure to describe/summarize data

---

# The Mean in Research

* Most statistics revolve around the mean

* Can't just trust descriptive statistics like the mean

---

# Deviation

* The distance a participant's score/value is from the mean/average

* Deviations can be positive or negative
  - participants can score lower (negative) than the mean and higher (positive) than the mean
  
* To get the deviation, you subtract the mean from each participant's score

* $$ X - \overline{X} $$

* The larger the value the farther away from the mean the score/value is

* **Sum of the deviations around the mean** is the sum of all differences between the scores and the mean

---

# Looking to the Future

* Deviations is the start for upcoming lectures and statistical tests, especially the sum of the deviations

* $$ \Sigma(X - \overline{X}) $$

* If the sum of the deviations is 0 then that means your math is good

* Deviation of each score/value from the mean is often referred to as error/residual in statistical tests

* Correlational designs use the mean of IV and the mean of DV to look for a relationship between the two variables

* Experiments compare the two or more groups (IV) and the relationship with the mean value/score of the DV

---

# Visuals

* Line Graphs are good for showing progress or change in time

* To show group differences (nominal or ordinal IV), bar graphs are the norm

* Scatterplots are best for continuous IV and continuous DV (interval or ratio)

---

# Describing the Population Mean

* $$ \mu = Population\;Mean $$

* If you test a population then you would use mu instead of xbar

* $$ \mu = \frac{\Sigma\;X}{N} $$

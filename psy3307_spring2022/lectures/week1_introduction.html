# What I Need From You

- Cameras are optional
  - It helps me see if you are confused
  
- Unmute yourself and interrupt me

- put in the chat that you are confused

- private message me in the chat that you are confused

# Review

- **Variable**
  - anything that can produce different scores; scores that vary

- **Relationship**
  - the connection between two variables

- Three different types of relationships
  - **positive relationship** is when one variable increases, the second variable increases
  - **negative relationship** is when one variable increases, the second variable decreases
  - **no relationship** shows no clear connection between two variables

# Poll: Is it a Variable?

- Height
- Age
- Class Standing
- Name

# Relationships

# Descriptive &amp; Inferential Statistics

* **Descriptive Statistics** used for organizing and summarizing your data. 

* Tells the reader how the data looks.

* **Inferential Statistics** used to estimate or infer if there is a relationship in your sample data that represents the population studying

* Tells the reader if there is a relationship.

---

# Examples of Descriptive &amp; Inferential Statistics

1. The average amount of physical inactivity in California counties
2. The association between parks and physical activity engaged 
3. The *difference* in the number of liquor stores between San Diego and Los Angeles counties.  
4. The number of males and females in PSY 3307. 

---

# Types of Research

- **Qualitative**
  - testing theories using language
  
- **Quantitative**
  - testing theories with numbers

---

# Poll: Types of Research

- Finding the average age of students that take PSY 3307 
- Conducting interviews with people on why they won't get vaccinated
- Focus groups on improving graduation rates at CPP
- Testing to see if drinking more coffee makes you better at math

---

# Variables

- **Independent variables** are often seen as the cause of some effect
  - Experimental designs = cause
  - Correlational designs = predictor
  - **Predictor variable** predicts an outcome; IV --&gt; DV

- **Dependent variables** are variables that are affected by the independent variable(s)
  - Outcome based on changes from the independent variable
  - Also called **outcome variable**

- Independent variables = IV

- Dependent variables = DV

- This class, most analyses will be focused on one IV and one DV
  - More advanced statistics can have multiples of both

---

# Conditions

* **Conditions** are the categories of the IV to measure DV scores in an experiment

* Example: Examining test scores of students in a class. Half of the class gets a study guide while the other half is given nothing.

IV = Study guide
DV = Test scores
Conditions: 1 = Group receiving study guide; 2 = Group receiving nothing (control group)

* For experiments, you can say "IV had an effect on DV" or the "IV caused DV" but for correlational students that is a big NO NO. Every time JP hears/reads a correlational study that describes the effect of IV on DV he cries a little inside.

# Levels of Measurement

- What is being measured and the numbers that represent what is being measured is the **level of measurement**

- **Categorical variables**
  - entities are divided into distinct categories
  - variables that do not allow fractions
  
- Ex: Getting an 94.5 on a exam

- **Continuous variables**
  - a score for each person/distinct score
  - variables that can be measured with decimals
  
- Ex: Being a 4th year compared to a 3rd year student

---

# Categorical Variables

- **Binary variables**
  - there are only two categories (sex)

- **Nominal variables**
  - categorize into groups; categories are not ordered (race/ethnicity groups)
  - can be binary and nominal

- **Ordinal variables**
  - ordered categories
  - categories indicate rank order (race order)

---

# Continuous Variables

- **Interval variables**
  - equal intervals on the variable represent equal differences in measurement
  - zero is not an absolute zero

- **Ratio variables**
  - similar to interval
  - true zero (zero is the smallest number)

---

# Measurement Scale Examples

1. California Counties
2. Temperature measured in Celcius
2b. Temperature measured in Kelvin
3. Olympic Medal Winners (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
4. Money
5. Income Brackets [0-10k, 11-20k, 21-30k, ...]
6. Miles per hour (mpg)
7. 10 most common baby names
8. Grades (A, B, C, D, F)
9. Grades (100-95, 94-90, 89-85, 84-80, ...)
10. Grades (100-0%)

---

# Measurement Error

- **Measurement error** is the discrepancy between the actual value you're trying to measure and the value you obtained

- A participant's ID states a weight of 130lbs

- Their actual weight is 134lbs

- There is a measurement error of 4lbs

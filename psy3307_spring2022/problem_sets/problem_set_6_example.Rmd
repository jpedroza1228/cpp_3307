```{r}
compare <- data.frame(group1 = c(4, 8, 9, 10, 9),
                      group2 = c(3, 2, 2, 4, 1))
compare
```

## What are our two hypotheses

H0:
H1:

## Get the means for both groups


## Get the n for both groups


## Get the df and sum of squares values for both groups

$$
SS = \sum(X - \overline{X})^2
$$


## What are the variance and standard deviation values for both groups

$$
S^2 = \frac{SS}{df}
$$

$$
S = \sqrt{\frac{SS}{df}}
$$

## calculate the standard error for both groups

$$
S_{\overline{X}} = \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \;\;OR\;\;S_{\overline{X}} = \frac{S^2}{n}
$$

$$
S_{\overline{X}} = \frac{S^2}{n}
$$

## Get the standard error of the differences between groups

$$
S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{S^2_{2}}{n_{2}}}
$$

## If those groups are different, remember to correct for different n sizes in each group

$$
S^2_{p} = \frac{(n_{1} - 1)S^2_{1} + (n_{2} - 1)S^2_{2}}{n_{1} + n_{2} - 2}
$$

$$
S_{\overline{X_{1}} - \overline{X_{2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2_{p}}{n_{1}} + \frac{S^2_{p}}{n_{2}}}
$$

## What are the degrees of freedom to use for our t-table

$$
df = (n_{1} - 1) + (n_{2} - 1)
$$


## what is our t-obtained value

$$
t_{obt} = \frac{\overline{X}_{1} - \overline{X}_{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{S^2_{p}}{n_{1}} + \frac{S^2_{p}}{n_{2}}}}
$$


## Is it significant?
